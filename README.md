## Overview

`slidev-react` is an experimental slide system built around:

- React 19 for rendering
- MDX as the authoring format
- Vite for the app runtime
- a compile-time deck pipeline under `src/deck`
- a presentation shell with presenter/viewer sync, reveal flow, drawings, and recording

This repo is not a Vue Slidev runtime. It is a React + MDX implementation that borrows some presentation ideas while using its own deck model and rendering pipeline.

## Highlights

- MDX-authored deck source in [`slides.mdx`](./slides.mdx)
- Compile-time parsing and deck artifact generation
- Built-in slide layouts such as `default`, `center`, `cover`, `section`, `two-cols`, `image-right`, and `statement`
- React-native MDX helpers including `Badge`, `Callout`, `AnnotationMark`, `Reveal`, and `RevealGroup`
- Diagram fences for Mermaid and PlantUML
- KaTeX-based math rendering
- Presenter and viewer routes with sync-ready state handling
- Multi-tab sync through `BroadcastChannel`
- Optional cross-device sync through a WebSocket relay
- Stage drawing tools, cursor sync, quick overview, and browser recording

## Status

The project is currently an MVP / playground. APIs, authoring conventions, and deck capabilities may still change.

## Release Positioning

This repository is an open-source application/runtime repo, not an npm package. Keep `"private": true` in `package.json` to prevent accidental publication, and treat source checkout as the supported way to use or extend the project.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js `>=22`
- Bun `1.3.3`

### Install

```bash
bun install
```

### Start development

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Build production assets

```bash
bun run build
```

### Preview the build

```bash
bun run preview
```

### Clean generated output

```bash
bun run clean
```

## Presentation Mode

Start the app first:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Optional: start the relay server for cross-device sync:

```bash
bun run presentation:server
```

Default relay endpoint: `ws://localhost:4860/ws`

Routes:

- Presenter: `http://localhost:5173/presenter/1`
- Viewer: `http://localhost:5173/1`

The presenter shell currently includes:

- presenter / viewer roles
- page sync
- reveal-state sync
- cursor sync
- drawing sync
- browser recording via `MediaRecorder`
- quick overview and presenter-side controls

## Deck Authoring

The deck source lives in [`slides.mdx`](./slides.mdx).

Core authoring rules:

- Use `---` to split slides
- Use frontmatter for deck or slide metadata
- Use MDX for slide content
- Use repo-provided React components directly in MDX

Supported frontmatter today:

- Deck: `title`, `theme`, `layout`
- Slide: `title`, `layout`, `class`

Notes:

- `layout:` is active and affects rendering
- `class:` is applied to the stage article element
- `theme:` is parsed as metadata but is not yet wired into runtime theme switching

Example:

```mdx
---
title: Demo Deck
layout: default
---

---

title: Compare
layout: two-cols
class: px-20

---

# Left column

<hr />

# Right column

<Reveal step={1}>
  <Callout title="Tip">This block appears on click.</Callout>
</Reveal>
```

## MDX Helpers

Common helpers exposed to MDX include:

- `Badge`
- `Callout`
- `AnnotationMark`
- `CourseCover`
- `MagicMoveDemo`
- `MinimaxReactVisualizer`
- `Reveal`
- `RevealGroup`
- `MermaidDiagram`
- `PlantUmlDiagram`

`AnnotationMark` example:

```mdx
<AnnotationMark>Default highlight</AnnotationMark>
<AnnotationMark type="underline">Key idea</AnnotationMark>
<AnnotationMark type="box" color="#2563eb">
  API boundary
</AnnotationMark>
<AnnotationMark type="bracket" brackets={["left", "right"]}>
  Focus block
</AnnotationMark>
```

## Project Structure

Top-level source areas under [`src/`](./src):

- `app/`: application assembly, providers, entry wiring
- `deck/`: deck parsing, frontmatter handling, MDX compilation, generated artifacts
- `features/`: presentation capabilities such as reveal, presenter shell, sync, draw, and navigation
- `features/player/`: stage rendering and stage interaction
- `ui/`: reusable presentation components and MDX helpers
- `theme/`: layouts and visual tokens

For more internal structure guidance, see [`src/README.md`](./src/README.md).

## Scripts

- `bun run clean`: remove generated output such as `dist/`, `.generated/`, and `output/`
- `bun run dev`: start the development server
- `bun run build`: build the app
- `bun run preview`: preview the production build
- `bun run presentation:server`: start the WebSocket relay server
- `bun run test`: run the Vitest suite
- `bun run test:e2e`: run the Playwright end-to-end suite
- `bun run test:e2e:headed`: run the Playwright suite with a visible browser
- `bun run test:e2e:install`: install the Chromium browser used by Playwright
- `bun run lint`: run type-aware Oxlint on `src/`
- `bun run format`: format the repository with Oxfmt
- `bun run format:check`: check repository formatting with Oxfmt

## Build Artifact Management

Build output is disposable and should not be committed. In this repository:

- `dist/` is generated by production builds
- `.generated/` is compile-time deck output
- `output/` is treated as generated runtime output

Before opening a PR, remove generated files with `bun run clean` if they are unrelated to the change.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
bun run test
```

## Acknowledgements

This project is inspired by [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev), and some early deck content was migrated from the Slidev starter deck while adapting the authoring model to this React + MDX runtime.
